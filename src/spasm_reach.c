/**
 * depth-first-search of the graph of a matrix, starting at column j.
 *
 * The traversal works as follow : starting from a column j, find the
 * row containing the pivot on this column (row "inew"). If there is not pivot on column j, stop.
 *
 * When a pivot row has been found, append its next unseen entry to the stack, and restart.
 *
 * @param qinv
 *           qinv[j] indicates the row on which the j-th column pivot can be found.
 *           qinv[j] == -1 means that there is no pivot on column j.
 *
 * The matrix need not be square. If n < m, then qinv must be non-NULL, and
 * qinv[j] = -1 that there is no pivot on column j
 *
 * @param j column at which the traversal starts.
 *
 * @param G the graph to search
 *
 * @param xj : size m. Used both as workspace and to return the result. At the end, the
 * list of traversed nodes is in xj[top:m]
 *
 * @param pstack size-n workspace. Used to count the neighbors already traversed.
 *
 * @marks : size-m workspace. Indicates which column nodes have been dealt with.
 *
 * @return top
